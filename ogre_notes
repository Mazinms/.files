grid
----
* change from float/pixel based position to a grid
** some exchange rate between two, perhaps 10 pixel to a grid point
** units can only be at center of grid
*** for now, just round all positions to nearest grid point (round to nearest ten's digit)
*** do for movement and target position.
** movement is to adjacent grid point
*** first, still straight lines, compute direction and move unit to nearest center of grid point (so faster to move on diagonal)
*** later, shortest path
** have every object store its location
** have each town check if it's captured/held
*** only need to check all spaces within radius ( say 5 or whatever)
** translate all mouse clicks to nearest pixel position
** don't let units overlap?? (allied units that is)
