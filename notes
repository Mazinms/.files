Microphone issues
-----------------
* run amixer, notice that Internal Mic only has playback, no capture listed among capabilities.  don't know if anyone else has run into this, but I've seen a couple other instances of people with not working microphones under linux.
* If I turn off the mic boost, then it does record!  madness!  probably don't need pulseaudio at all then

Touchpad
--------
* Patch no longer works in the diff, the actual kernel must have changed too much
* I can probably hack it if I figure out what I'm doing
** download git repo of the kernel (hoo-boy)
** copy modifications from the patch to this version
** enjoy!
** just need to change line numbers really, try 390 instead of 385
** 449 -> 433
*** derp, the file for c720 actually succeeded!
** but I need the other files like patch 3074391
*** looks like some lines got added in, should be easy fix,
*** just change where it gets put in perhaps?
*** 2nd hunk, line 233, now the kernel does 'probing' stuff that may muck with it.  Take a look at this more this weekend
* or, see if chrubuntu put out a new patch set and use those

Back to ChromeOS
----------------
* croagh = crouton + arch
# save off these notes, ogre battle notes, and job notes
# reinstall chromeos onto laptop
# install croagh
# fiddle with arch to be what I want
# enjoy sweet sweet arch and chromeos at the same time
